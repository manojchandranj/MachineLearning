Implementation of decision tree learning algorithm using Octave. Information gain is used for deciding on the best attribute for tree branching.

	Need to implement a function to print the decision tree to standard output in the below format and also need to find which dataset produces best accuracy.

	|XO = 0:
	||XM = 0:
	|||XF = 0:
	||||XB = 0:
	|||||XG = 0:0
	|||||XG= 1:
	||||||XD = 0:
